Try it here [link to view the app](https://vitalikplus.github.io/banner-manager-angularjs/ "banner-manager app")

#### The possible improvements: 
1. As a user I should change the size of the selected banner by resizing it using mouse 
2. Fix the bug which occurs at dragging banners((
3. Use more angular.js features? 
4. Analyse the performance and check if there are any excessive code or data? 
5. Anything else?
